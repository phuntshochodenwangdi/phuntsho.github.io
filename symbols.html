<h2>What does the name "Femme Forte" symbolize?</h2>
  <p> Femme Forte is the french word for strong women  .This phrase  is  in opposition to the  social assumption that women are fragile,
  weak  unlike men  who are displayed as macho and strong .The phrase expresses women's strength and their courage .Just like
   how the saying goes that women  are like tea bags ,you never know how strong they are until they get in hot water,Femme Forte signifies
   the immeasurable strength of a women that can not be seen  in her physical appearance but rather in how strong headed, brave ,
   courageous and patient she is in her everyday struggles. </p>

  <h2>What does the logo symbolize? </h2>
  <img src="symbol.jpg" class="center"
  <br>
  <p> The logo for Femme Forte comprises of a fierce eye with  heavy make up.People always have the prejudice that only women can wear makeup,
    so the make up applied eyes is to show gender equity in behaviour, conveying the message that not all women need to  wear makeup and the
    ones who apply makeup  doesn't necessarily  have to be a woman, and that even boys can be interested in skin care and beautification ,after
    all , who doesn't want to look good?.The fierce eye symbolizes the strength  that woman possess which most people assume that
      women do  not have.The pink eyeshadow shows the conception people have that every girl's favourite color is pink , which
      is not true.Pink can be liked by men as well ,pink need not be considered feminine and blue man-ish .All these cliche ideas have no logical reasoning
      behind it , still it is prevalent in peopl's mind.</p>
      <br>
  <h2>How was the logo created ?</h2>
  <p>I found an app on play store called design evolution,so  while i scrolled through the already created design for a logo,i thought
    about everything that i wanted to express through my logo and the logo of the eye seemed to do it.So i edited the logo ,added the
    name of my website,and chose the borders .Finally, my logo was complete!</p>
