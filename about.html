       <h2>About the creator</h2>
       <br>
       <img src="bnw.jpg" class="center">
        <p>The creater of this website " Femme Forte" is a 15 year old student  named Phuntsho Choden Wangdi studying in 11th grade from Bhutan.
         From a young age , Phuntsho observed how she was always expected to help her mom with the household chores and how her brother was never asked to help
         clean the house or do the dishes.She was always told by the people around her that she needed to behave prim and proper and not play rough and tough games
       because she was a girl.She was always called a tom boy  because she played with the boys, and because she wasn't interested in cooking .So finally, after
     she got the  golden opportunity  to learn how to create a website from SOW coders,she decided to create a website where she could share the unequal treatment women get ,
   the orthodox ideas that hold girls of her age from being who they are , the harsher world that women have to live in and how we can create a gender equal society
   without hurting the sentiments of  our fellow  men at the same time. </p>
