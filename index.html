  <h2>What is Gender Inequality? </h2>
    <p> Gender inequality is the idea that men and women are not equal and that gender affects an individual's living experience. These differences arise from distinctions in biology, psychology, and cultural norms.
      Some of these types of distinctions are empirically grounded while others appear to be socially constructed..This  can have a long-time effect on one's upbringing,liberty and rights .For an instance ,
      the percentage of girls enrolled in school to boys in underdeveloped nations is extremely low.This consequently leads to lesser working women and the illerate portion of women affects the economic development
    of a country.</p>

    <h2> How can we achieve Gender Equality? </h2>
<img src="kid.jpg"
<br>
    <ol> We can contibute towards gender equality by:
      <li> Educating women.Education is the first step towards a future .By educating girls ,we not only help them build their  future but we
        help them learn  about their interest and grow skills so that they can help develop their society and consequently the world. </li>
        <br>
        <img src="education.jpg"
        <br>
          <li> Giving equal opportunity in making decisions .We should treat all  genders with equal respect and provide them equal opportunities to decide on topics. This enables women to become confident in making
            their own choices and speaking out their opinions , being aware of the fact that their opinion counts and matters equally.</li>
            <br>
        <li> Not creating stereotypes.The reason most women are not given equal privileges in life is due to the stereotypical thought that people have that women are fragile and weaker compared to men making them of
          lesser value .If we do not create stereotypes of how women or people in general shouldn't be or how they should behave and how they should carry themselves out , everyone will be treated the same and
          have the liberty to choose how they want to live their life. The same goes for boys , the stereotype that man have to be strong and shouldn't cry are just limiting factors because of which men aren't able
        to  freely express themselves.  </li>

    <br>

        </ol>
      <h2> Why is Gender Inequality an important issue? </h2> <img src="wondering.jpg"
      <br>

<p>  Gender inequality is an important issue we should all be aware about  because, we are all children of God and we should be considered as one but  we are being categorized into what we can do and what we can't do based
     on nothing but  our sex and it isn't fair because we aren't able to be our true self and make our own decisions on what we want to wear , what we want to be and a whole lot more .Who says men should not  wear makeup?
      who says women should not  stay out late ? It is just not fair that men have to be strong and women fragile. After all, we are all human  and all we are asking for is the same treatment ,the same respect , the same
      rights  and thats it. We should all know about gender inequality  because  there are women around the world who  are not being treated as equal, they are still considered  slaves , an item  in a showroom, an assistant
       to men  and this is just not it.There are some people in the world wishing for a son to be born instead of a daughter just because the society thinks that woman can not bring honor and wealth to their family .So inorder
        to bring justice tothe girl who was killed right after being born by her father because she was a girl, for the little Priya who is cooking food for her father instead of studying  with her brother ,for Dema who was married to a
        man 15 years older than her without her consent or Cassie who was not accepted into the neighbourhood baseball team just because she was a girl. This is for them as well as for ourselves .Yet what do we chose to do? We
       choose to stare at the ball  lying in our court.But what we do not realize is that  by not doing anything against it, we are just surrendering ourselves to these invisible barriers. </p>

<h2> Who can help towards this anti-discriminatory movement? </h2>
<img src="all.jpg"
<br>
<p> The answer to this question would be EVERYONE. Eveyone can do their small part in creating a free society where our gender doesn't matter.Parents can teach their children about gender equity by giving them equal attention
  and setting good examples on how everyone should behave instead of feeding into their brains that this is men's job or cooking is women's job.Teachers' can teach students from a young age that you can become whatever you
  want to be in life without listening to the ones that say you can't. For example: people say that being a mechanic or a travel guide is not something a women can become or that women belong in kitchens, but teachers being
  the  ultimate source of a child's information can teach them otherwise .That way a child will not be introduced to differentiation of genders. Husbands can support their wives  by dividing the chores, encouraging her growth in her career ,
  give her the freedom to decide what she does instead of ordering her to do things.Women could help other women in need and empower them by telling them to fight against the injustice that they suffer instead of giving up the
   fight .Employers could fix a unit start up salary and promote his emplyees strictly  based on their performance. If all of us do a little something towards this movement, the probability of extincting inequality is higher than
  a few of us  doing amazing things for it.</p>

<h2> What are the evidences of gender inequality?</h2>
<img src="difference.jpg"
<br>
<p>The proofs/ evidences that show that gender iequality is still happening can be seen in the following cases: </p>
<ol>
<li> About 12 million girls are married before they turn 18.That is roughly about 33,000 everyday or one everyday two seconds.These girls become child brides under compulsion .The reasson behind this is often because girls are
  not valued as highly as boys in some societies and the people of these backward societies believe that marrying them off at a young age transfers the 'economic burden' to another family .This shows how the society considers
  having a girl child as a burden and less prestigious compared to  having boys.</li>
  <img src="childbrides.jpg"
  <br>
  <li> Women make less money than their male counterparts.</li>
    <br>
    <img src="paygap.jpg"
    <br>
  <p>The fact that female employees are paid lesser than the males is a solid proof that women are being discriminated in their career pathway . It is  a depressing truth that  a woman's effort is appreciated less .Even when female
     workers put equal effort into their work just as men , it is outrageous that men are paid higher .This  creates an income gap between genders  and consequently , the living standards are affected as well.</p>

<br>
  <li> Women still shoulder more of the household burden.</li>
<br>
<img src="hurdles.jpg"
<br>
<p>No matter how educated or successful a woman is in her career , she is still the one who does more of the chores,takes care of her children and makes food for the family .And studies have shown that women  take more leave than men
  to look after sick kids, or help their children during exam time. It is because of all the hurdles  she has to jump over before  reaching the starting point where men are that the working population of women is lower than men's . A woman
  has to balance her career as well as her personal life just as a man has to but the difference is that she has to take about 75% responsibility of the chores,where as a man does only 25% of the chores in most cases.</p>
<br>
  <li> Women are at greater risk to rape and harassment.</li>
    <br>
    <img src="harassment.jpg"
   <br>
 <p>The unfair treatment doesn't stop just in unequal treatment but to the extreme , women are more likely to be harassed  sexually and verbally as displayed in the video below.And they  are common victims to human trafficking .We can
  see through such events  that to some people , women are just items in a showroom  that you can buy if you like and use it anyway you want.But  to me this is aboslutely false , women are more than that , we are smart,kind ,loving,courageous
and selfless heroes without capes.</p>

<h2> In which field are women crossing barriers? </h2>
<br>
<p> In the techonological field, the portion of women working has been incresing rapidly .Consequently ,they use the technological advancement in  protecting,empowering and inspiring women to do more ,to do better and to break out
  of their shells . Technology has played an important field in increasing women employment .</p>
  <br>

<br>
<h2>For gender equality , do we have to hate men? </h2>
<br>
<p>The answer is no. While we fight against gender discrimination , it is equally important that we do not discrimante against men or hate them .Fighting for gender equality means fighting for equal opportunity and not bearing ill will against
   men because it wasn't them who created these barriers for us, although some of them did implement them, but it was the rotten part of the society with some  women included that created orthodox ideas for how we should be and how we shouldn't be ,
   what we can do and what we can't and etc..Infact some men are with us in this fight, not because they are doing it for the female members in their family , but they are doing it because they know that if all of us are one ,the world would
   be a fair and wonderful  place to live in.Neutrality is a vital aspect of bringing gender equality, it is necessary that we support women without being sexists. </p>
